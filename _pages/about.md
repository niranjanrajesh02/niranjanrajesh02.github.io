I am a final-year student at Ashoka University completing my Computer Science major. My current interests lie in Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience and Computer Vision. I want to design elegant artificially intelligent systems by employing insights from the study of biological intelligence.

I am currently working on my undergraduate capstone thesis on the topics of disentagling neural manifolds in networks and Brain-inspired CNNs with [Professor Debayan Gupta](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/debayan-gupta/) and [Professor Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/venkat/profile).

I like playing video games with my friends, getting humbled in Muay Thai kickboxing and rewatching the same three sitcoms in my free time.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
